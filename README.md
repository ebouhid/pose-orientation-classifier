# Pose Orientation Classifier

## Purpose

This project aims to classify the orientation of images into four categories: `back`, `front`, `left`, and `right`. The project includes scripts for training, evaluating, and inferring the orientation of images using a deep learning model.
Below is an example image showing the four orientations that the model can classify:

##  Model Architecture

The chosen model architecture consists of a backbone network for feature extraction and fully connected (FC) layers for classification. The backbone network is a pre-trained ResNet model, and the FC layers are used to map the extracted features to the four orientation classes.

### Backbone

The backbone network is a pre-trained ResNet model from the `timm` library. It extracts the last feature map from the input images.

### Fully Connected Layers

The FC layers consist of:
- A dropout layer with a probability of 0.5
- A linear layer with 128 units and ReLU activation
- Another dropout layer with a probability of 0.5
- A final linear layer with 4 units (one for each class)

## Usage

### Training

To train the model, use the `train.py` script. The script defines the data augmentation, loads the dataset, and trains the model using PyTorch Lightning.

### Evaluation

To evaluate the model, use the `test.py` script. The script loads the trained model and evaluates its performance on a test dataset.

### Inference

To classify and split unstructured images by orientation, use the `split_files.py` script. The script loads the trained model, processes the images, and saves them into corresponding folders based on their predicted orientation.

#### Example Command

```sh
python split_files.py --input_dir path/to/input/images --output_dir path/to/output/folders --model_path path/to/model/checkpoint --batch_size 32
```

## üìÇ Dataset Organization

The dataset should be organized into subdirectories for each asset, with images named to indicate their orientation. Here is an example of how the directory should be organized:

```
data/
    person1/
        image_front.jpg
        image_back.jpg
        image_left.jpg
        image_right.jpg
    person2/
        image_front.jpg
        image_back.jpg
        image_left.jpg
        image_right.jpg
    person3/
        image_front.jpg
        image_back.jpg
        image_left.jpg
        image_right.jpg
    ...
```
